# 2022-F1-stats
This was my final project for my engineering class which tasked me with picking a data set and presenting a result from the data. In this project, I took a look at the 2022 formula 1 season to see if there was correlation between a drivers starting grid position and their position at the end of the race.

This was my first time using web scraping in a project. In scrape.py, I scrape the F1 website for the race results and starting grid positions and turn them into a folder of csv files that correlation.py then uses to create a plot of the correlation between starting and ending positions in one or all races.
